## Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Jasmine Vu and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http:/ww.fullerton.edu) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab four focused on the conversion of volumes to millileters in the metric system to various units in the US customary system as well as an arbitrary guessing game. I enjoyed this lab because this was the first lab where arithmetics was introduced and so was the concept of if statements. In the lab, I used the mathematical formula to convert various measurements and in part two, I worked alongside my partner to create a game that focused on the guess of a winning arbitrary integer. 

* Lab 7

Lab seven centered around the concept of function definitions and command line arguments. Both of these learning topics were utilized to execute date differences as well as the implementation of parking restrictions. I enjoyed this particular lab because my partner and I were able to apply our knowledge from a previous lab in order to make the problem solving easier. 

* Lab 12

In lab 12, my partner and I created a program that when ran, outputted a colored gif with the text " CPSC120" as well as generating a random coin flip. Utilizing the function "RandomDouble01()" we were able to generate arbitrary integers corresponding to various coin flips and by using the arithmetic functions provided, my partner and I were able to compute by analyzing basic geometric functions in order to manipulate different color intensities. In additon to the codes, we also worked with object oriented classes which I am still relatively unfamiliar with so this project widened my perspective on C++.
