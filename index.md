### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab four focused on the conversion of volumes to millileters in the metric system to various units in the US customary system as well as an arbitrary guessing game. I enjoyed this lab because this was the first lab where arithmetics was introduced and so was the concept of if statements. In the lab, I used the mathematical formula to convert various measurements and in part two, I worked alongside my partner to create a game that focused on the guess of a winning arbitrary integer. 

* Lab 7

Lab seven centered around the concept of function definitions and command line arguments. Both of these learning topics were utilized to execute date differences as well as the implementation of parking restrictions. I enjoyed this particular lab because my partner and I were able to apply our knowledge from a previous lab in order to make the problem solving easier. 

* Lab 8

Lab eight pertained to the idea of data cleaning and the calculation of the average of numbers given as command line arguments. When both concepts are applied, our program outputs a word lib game “Mad Libs” and the computation of the arithmetic mean. This lab was interesting because my partner and I made us of the double and the float variable.
